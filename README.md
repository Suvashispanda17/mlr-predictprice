🌟 Day 2 of Machine Learning Journey 🌟

🔍 Exploring Multiple Linear Regression (MLR):
Today, I worked on implementing Multiple Linear Regression using Python and scikit-learn. By training the model on a dataset with features like area, bedrooms, and house age, I aimed to predict property prices.

📊 Visualizations:

Created a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between area and price.
Plotted the regression line to show the model's predictions, highlighting its ability to capture trends.
🧠 Key Takeaways:

Learned how to use multiple independent variables in regression to predict outcomes using the formula:
y = m1x1 + m2x2 + m3x3 + b
Observed the importance of data preprocessing and feature selection in creating accurate predictions.
💻 Next Steps:

Dive deeper into understanding regression coefficients and residual analysis to enhance model performance.
